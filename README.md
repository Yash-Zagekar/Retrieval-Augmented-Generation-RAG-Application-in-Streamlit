# Chat with documents : Receive Immediate Insights from documents


Chat with documents is an advanced Streamlit application designed to extract and analyze text from various document formats, utilizing the powerful capabilities of Google's Generative AI, specifically the Gemini-PRO model. This tool employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to provide highly accurate, context-sensitive responses to user queries, drawing on the content within the uploaded documents. By processing the text of these documents, the application is able to deliver detailed and relevant information, ensuring that users receive precise answers tailored to the specific content they upload. This system enhances the user experience by facilitating efficient and intelligent document-based interactions.
## Features

- **Instant Analysis**: Extracts and processes text from uploaded documents to deliver immediate, valuable insights.
- **Contextual AI Responses**: Leverages Google's Gemini-PRO Generative AI model for delivering accurate and context-aware answers.
